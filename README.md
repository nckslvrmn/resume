# resume

My serverless automated resume. Uses github actions to render the html, publish
the rendered html to s3, then invalidates the cloudfront cache.

Original concept inspired by [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/) (and my
template is compatible with the json resume structure).

Original theme inspired by
[kwan](https://github.com/icoloma/jsonresume-theme-kwan)
